# Phormatter

A simple Firefox extension which adds a toolbar button for quick phone number cleanup. Click the button to open a popup window where you can paste or type any phone number. The extension automatically formats it by removing spaces, symbols, and the +1 country code for U.S. numbers. Perfect for copying clean numbers into forms, CRMs, or dialers.

Currently removes +1 US country code only.
